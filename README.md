Hi there, 
Thanks for checking out this Project. This is actually a project which i have developed as part of my college curriculam of 3rd Semester.
The goal of the project is to build a whatsapp utility in Python using which people(users) can send as well as schedule messages to be sent later.
This project is developed in Python 3 using Selenium as the main external library. Rest of the libraries used are: argparse,platform,time,datetime,os,etc.
Tkinter will be used in the later update of this project for the GUI based part.

Please have a look at the project code files i have included in the repo and let me know of any advice or suggestions for the next future releases. 
Any feedback or Suggestions are appreciated.
Thankyou.
